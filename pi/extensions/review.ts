/**
 * Unified /review + /triage + /fix extension.
 *
 * What this extension does:
 * - /review runs multiple parallel focuses (general, reuse, quality, efficiency),
 *   then emits a single findings report.
 * - /triage fetches PR feedback from GitHub, inspects the checked-out PR diff,
 *   and classifies each item as address, push_back, research, or ignore.
 * - /fix applies findings from the review report. If the latest message is not a
 *   valid/stale review payload, /fix runs a fresh review first and then fixes.
 *
 * Key behavior:
 * - /review is findings-only (no direct edits).
 * - /triage is feedback triage only (no direct edits).
 * - Focus outputs are strict JSON; final review output is human-readable markdown plus
 *   a typed custom message payload (customType: "review").
 * - /fix staleness checks use a repo fingerprint: HEAD SHA + branch + tracked diff hash + untracked content hash.
 *
 * Commands:
 * - /review [mode] [models=...] [context=...]
 * - /triage <number|url>
 * - /fix [mode] [models=...] [context=...]
 *
 * Modes supported by both commands:
 * - auto (default)
 * - uncommitted
 * - branch <name>
 * - commit <sha>
 * - pr <number|url>
 * - folder <paths...>
 * - custom "<instructions>"

const REVIEW_RUBRIC_PROMPT = `# Review Guidelines

You are acting as a code reviewer for a proposed code change made by another engineer.

Below are default guidelines for determining what to flag. These are not the final word — if you encounter more specific guidelines elsewhere (in a developer message, user message, file, or project review guidelines appended below), those override these general instructions.

## Determining what to flag

Flag issues that:
1. Meaningfully impact the accuracy, performance, security, or maintainability of the code.
2. Are discrete and actionable (not general issues or multiple combined issues).
3. Don't demand rigor inconsistent with the rest of the codebase.
4. Were introduced in the changes being reviewed (not pre-existing bugs).
5. The author would likely fix if aware of them.
6. Don't rely on unstated assumptions about the codebase or author's intent.
7. Have provable impact on other parts of the code — it is not enough to speculate that a change may disrupt another part, you must identify the parts that are provably affected.
8. Are clearly not intentional changes by the author.
9. Be particularly careful with untrusted user input and follow the specific guidelines to review.
10. Call out newly added dependencies explicitly and explain why they're needed.
11. Apply system-level thinking; flag changes that increase operational risk or on-call burden.

## Untrusted User Input

1. Be careful with open redirects, they must always be checked to only go to trusted domains (?next_page=...)
2. Always flag SQL that is not parametrized
3. In systems with user supplied URL input, http fetches always need to be protected against access to local resources (intercept DNS resolver!)
4. Escape, don't sanitize if you have the option (eg: HTML escaping)

## Comment guidelines

1. Be clear about why the issue is a problem.
2. Communicate severity appropriately - don't exaggerate.
3. Be brief - at most 1 paragraph.
4. Keep code snippets under 3 lines, wrapped in inline code or code blocks.
5. Use suggestion blocks ONLY for concrete replacement code (minimal lines; no commentary inside the block). Preserve the exact leading whitespace of the replaced lines.
6. Explicitly state scenarios/environments where the issue arises.
7. Use a matter-of-fact tone - helpful AI assistant, not accusatory.
8. Write for quick comprehension without close reading.
9. Avoid excessive flattery or unhelpful phrases like "Great job...".

## Priority levels

Tag each finding with a priority level in the title:
- [P0] - Drop everything to fix. Blocking release/operations. Only for universal issues that do not depend on assumptions about inputs.
- [P1] - Urgent. Should be addressed in the next cycle.
- [P2] - Normal. To be fixed eventually.
- [P3] - Low. Nice to have.`

1. Search for existing utilities and helpers that could replace newly written code. Start with ripgrep-style searches (use the grep tool first), then inspect utility directories, shared modules, and adjacent files.
2. Flag any new function that duplicates existing functionality. Suggest the existing function to use instead.
3. Flag any inline logic that could use an existing utility — hand-rolled string manipulation, manual path handling, custom environment checks, ad-hoc type guards, and similar patterns are common candidates.`,

1. Redundant state: state that duplicates existing state, cached values that could be derived, observers/effects that could be direct calls.
2. Parameter sprawl: adding new parameters to a function instead of generalizing or restructuring existing ones.
3. Copy-paste with slight variation: near-duplicate code blocks that should be unified with a shared abstraction.
4. Leaky abstractions: exposing internal details that should be encapsulated, or breaking existing abstraction boundaries.
5. Stringly-typed code: using raw strings where constants, enums (string unions), or branded types already exist in the codebase.
6. Simplicity: prefer simple, direct solutions over wrappers or abstractions without clear reuse value.
7. Fail-fast: favor explicit failures over logging-and-continue patterns that hide errors. Prefer predictable failure modes over silent degradation.
8. Error classification: ensure errors are checked against codes or stable identifiers, never error message strings.`,

1. Unnecessary work: redundant computations, repeated file reads, duplicate network/API calls, N+1 patterns.
2. Missed concurrency: independent operations run sequentially when they could run in parallel.
3. Hot-path bloat: new blocking work added to startup or per-request/per-render hot paths.
4. Unnecessary existence checks: pre-checking file/resource existence before operating (TOCTOU anti-pattern) — operate directly and handle the error.
5. Memory: unbounded data structures, missing cleanup, event listener leaks.
6. Overly broad operations: reading entire files when only a portion is needed, loading all items when filtering for one.
7. Backpressure: treat backpressure handling as critical to system stability; flag unbounded queues, missing flow control, or producer-consumer imbalances.`,

- Find concrete, high-confidence{FOCUS_QUALIFIER} issues introduced by the scoped changes.
- Output every finding the author would fix if they were made aware of it. Do not stop at the first qualifying finding — continue until you have listed every qualifying finding.
- Do not flag issues the author would not fix. If there is no finding that a person would definitely want to see and fix, prefer outputting no findings.

Important:
- Focus only on issues introduced in the reviewed scope.
- Keep each finding independent, discrete, and actionable.
- Assign each finding a priority P0..P3.

const FIX_PROMPT = `You are an expert software engineer applying fixes and improvements from a completed code review.

Use ONLY the findings in the review payload below as your worklist.
You are the decision-maker: if a finding is invalid, duplicate, too risky, or clearly not worth fixing, skip it with a brief reason and continue.

Process:
1) Work findings one by one in priority order: P0, P1, P2, P3.
2) For each finding:
   - Validate against current code.
   - If valid and worthwhile, implement the minimal correct fix.
   - If not, skip with a short reason.
3) Run relevant verification for touched code (targeted tests/checks preferred; avoid unnecessary full-suite runs).
4) Keep changes focused; avoid unrelated refactors.
5) Do not stop at first fix; continue through the whole list.

Output formatting requirements:
- In Verification, prefer plain text. If you cite executed commands, append them after a semicolon and wrap only the command snippet in inline backticks.
- In Notes, use plain prose. Use inline backticks sparingly when they improve clarity, such as for exact identifiers, paths, or command snippets.
- Do not use code fences.
- Do not include the pipe character in any cell text (including inside backticks). Avoid regex alternation patterns like (a|b); rewrite checks without pipes and separate multiple checks with semicolons.
- Decision values must be exactly fixed or skipped.

const TRIAGE_PROMPT = `You are an expert code reviewer triaging pull request feedback.

Your job is to classify each feedback item into exactly one of these decisions:
- address: the feedback is correct or worthwhile enough to handle in this PR.
- push_back: the feedback seems incorrect, inapplicable, or not worth changing.
- research: you cannot decide yet without external docs, repo conventions, or further verification.
- ignore: the item is non-actionable noise, already-resolved chatter, or has no remaining ask.

Process:
1) Review the scoped PR diff and relevant files before deciding.
2) Use the diff command in the scope instructions as mandatory context.
3) Triage every feedback item exactly once. Do not omit any id.
4) If a review thread contains back-and-forth, focus on the latest remaining ask.
5) Resolved or outdated threads often become ignore, but verify before deciding.
6) This is a read-only triage. Do not modify files or repository state; do not run mutating commands.

Run findings-only code review in 4 parallel focuses (general, reuse, quality, efficiency).

### Syntax
- \`/review [mode] [models=<a,b>] [context=<text>]\`
- \`/fix [mode] [models=<a,b>] [context=<text>]\`
- \`/triage <number|url>\`

### Modes
- \`auto\` (default): working tree first, then branch diff vs base branch.
- \`uncommitted\`: review tracked + untracked local changes.
- \`branch <name>\`: review diff from merge-base(name)..HEAD.
- \`commit <sha>\`: review one commit.
- \`pr <number|url>\`: checkout PR branch and review against PR base.
- \`folder <paths...>\`: snapshot review of files/folders (no git diff).
- \`custom "<instructions>"\`: custom scoped review instructions.

### Options
- \`models=<a,b>\`: run all review focuses for each listed model.
- \`context=<text>\`: add extra guidance to every review focus.
  - For spaces, quote the value, e.g. \`context="security and backpressure"\`.

### Examples
- \`/review\`
- \`/review help\`
- \`/review branch main\`
- \`/review pr 123 models=sonnet,gpt-5\`
- \`/review uncommitted context="security and error handling"\`
- \`/triage 123\`
- \`/triage https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123\`
- \`/fix\`
- \`/fix help\`
- \`/fix branch main models=sonnet\`

### /fix behavior
- Uses only the latest \`customType: "review"\` message payload.
- If payload is missing or stale, runs a fresh \`/review\` first.
- Skips execution when there are zero findings.

### /triage behavior
- Fetches PR feedback from GitHub for the given PR number or URL.
- Checks out the PR branch locally, then inspects the diff and repository state.
- Produces one triage row per feedback item with decision \`address\`, \`push_back\`, \`research\`, or \`ignore\`.`,
